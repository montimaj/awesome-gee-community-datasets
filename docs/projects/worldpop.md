# WorldPop Global Population Data 2015-2030

WorldPop's Global 2015-2030 gridded demographic datasets provide high-resolution population estimates using a 'top-down' methodology that disaggregates administrative unit population counts to 100m grid cells. This dataset represents a significant improvement over previous global population datasets, incorporating the latest circa-2020 round of censuses, updated geospatial covariates, improved settlement mapping, and building footprints derived from satellite imagery using AI approaches. The dataset provides annual population estimates at 100m resolution for 242 countries globally, covering the period 2015-2030. The methodology employs a Random Forest (RF) dasymetric approach to spatially disaggregate population counts from administrative boundaries to grid cells, using machine learning models trained on comprehensive geospatial covariates including settlement data, environmental variables, and infrastructure features.

The population data were collected from the two most recent census rounds (circa 2010 and 2020), supplemented with UN Common Operational Datasets, US Census Bureau projections, and official estimates where census data were unavailable. Various demographic methods were applied to interpolate age and sex-disaggregated totals between years and project to 2030, with national totals aligned to the UN World Population Prospects 2024 estimates. You can download the datasets from [Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)](https://data.humdata.org/organization/worldpop)

#### Constrained vs Unconstrained Models

WorldPop employs two main modeling approaches but only the constrained datasets are added here:

**Constrained Models**: Population estimates are limited to areas identified as human settlements, using built settlement layers derived from satellite imagery. This approach assumes people only reside in areas with buildings or infrastructure, providing more realistic population distributions by excluding uninhabitable areas like water bodies, protected areas, or steep terrain.

**Unconstrained Models**: Population can be allocated to any land area within administrative boundaries, regardless of settlement presence. While this may result in population being assigned to uninhabitable areas, it can be useful for applications where the exact settlement boundaries are uncertain or where temporary populations might exist outside formal settlements.
